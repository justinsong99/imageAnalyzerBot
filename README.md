DESCRIPTION: A chat bot that uses Azure Microsoft Bot Services and Microsoft's Cognitive Services to upload images as an attachment or as a link to analyze them. If faces exist in the image, this bot also has the ability to analyze each face as well.

This is not a completely finished git repository. However, it does contain the main components to the code. This git repository is being worked on and will be finished soon.
